Spending so much time at home has really allowed me to explore
my passion for the culinary arts. I've been watching a lot of YouTube
videos and reading a lot of recipe books, and as everyone knows,
once you do those things you're basically a MasterChef.

So today, I'd like to share some of my favorite meals to make.

## Breakfast

I use a prodigious amount of eggs for many of my breakfast meals.
This is evident in the act that my two favorite breakfasts to make
are Shakshuka (eggs poached in tomato sauce), and Eggs Benedict
(poached eggs with an english muffin, canadian bacon, and
hollandaise sauce).

If I'm not doing anything fancy like that for breakfast, I'll
usually just have some bacon, toast, and eggs. Most of my plain
eggs have been over-easy, but I've recently been converted to the
wonders of Gordon Ramsay style scrambled eggs and eggs fried in
olive oil.

## Lunch

I had trouble coming up with what I like to make for lunch. A lot of the
time, I just eat whatever's available in the fridge.
The occasional lunchtime meals I make include chicken fried rice and
stir-fry (hard to mess those up if you ask me). I also sometimes
take leftovers and try to make something new with them, like salmon
cakes out of leftover salmon, or a toasted croissant ham sandwich with
leftover ham.

## Dinner

For dinner I have a preference for something more substantial. One dish
that I sometimes make for special occasions is a simple filet mignon
with a red wine pan sauce. I shudder to think of how much the red
meat and butter is clogging my arteries, but whatever it is, the flavor
makes it worthwhile. THe steak is usually served with a side of small red
potatoes and some green vegetable like green beans, asparagus, or broccolini.
Sometimes if I find myself cooking dinner for one, I like to roast a singular
chicken breast at high heat. For that, I use a dry rub of salt, pepper,
smoked paprika, and garlic powder. That always hits the spot, especially right
out of the oven. Brining the chicken makes it even juicier.
