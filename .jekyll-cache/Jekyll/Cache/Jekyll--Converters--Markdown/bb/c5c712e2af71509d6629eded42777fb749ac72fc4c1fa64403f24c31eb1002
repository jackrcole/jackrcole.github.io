I"≠<h1 id="working-out">Working Out</h1>
<p>I just found out today that my local YMCA has closed for the foreseeable future as a result of, you guessed it, COVID19. It‚Äôs a shame because for the past few weeks, I have been doing really well with getting into a nice exercise routine. Hopefully, if I discuss my workout routine here, I will come up with a way to continue exercising without gym equipment.</p>

<p>On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays I lift weights, alternating ‚ÄúA‚Äù and ‚ÄúB‚Äù days:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Every lifting day:
    <ul>
      <li>I squat 5x5, starting with just the bar and logarithmically increasing the weight, following the 5th set with a set of three reps doing the heaviest weight I feel comfortable doing.</li>
      <li>Following my workout, I do Twenty-Ones, do three sets of twenty leg raises, and occasionally I will hang from a bar for as long as I can.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>On ‚ÄúA‚Äù days:
    <ul>
      <li>I do overhead presses, of 5 reps per set, doing sets until failure</li>
      <li>Following that, I deadlift for 1 set of 5 reps.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>On ‚ÄúB‚Äù days:
    <ul>
      <li>I bench 5 reps per set, doing as many sets as I think I can do without failing. I typically go without a spotter (not advisable, I know) so I try to be careful.</li>
      <li>After that, I do rows for 5x5 or until exhaustion.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I usually stick to this routine whenever I go to the gym alone, but whenever I weight-lift with my roommate Derek, I usually do what he does (he knows a lot more about lifting than I do).</p>

<p>Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, I do cardio:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When I first started running, I ran for five miles at a comfortable jogging pace, but I‚Äôve recently transitioned to doing shorter runs at a faster pace.</li>
  <li>Now, I typically run a 5K at a running pace. Soon, I might transition to running two miles at a time, but I like the affect that long distance running is having on my endurance, so I may just keep my distance to in between three and five miles.</li>
  <li>I have an end goal in mind: running two miles in fourteen minutes. This is a requirement to join UMD‚Äôs competitive boxing team, which is something I‚Äôd like to try out. So far, I‚Äôm making excellent progress.</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to the coronavirus, I no longer have a gym to go to, so I will have to make do with what I have at home. This shouldn‚Äôt affect my running too much, but I have very limited (albeit some) lifting equipment at my parent‚Äôs home, so I might find a way to replicate my workout the best I can with body weight exercises. I should be seeing Derek later this week, so I‚Äôll also ask him what he‚Äôs doing to maintain his gym body in the midst of the apocalypse.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, and leave a comment down below if you have any suggestions as to what I should do.</p>
