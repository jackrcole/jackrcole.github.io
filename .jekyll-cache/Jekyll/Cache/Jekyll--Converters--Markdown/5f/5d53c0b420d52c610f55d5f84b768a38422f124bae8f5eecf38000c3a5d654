I"9<p>A paper put together by a group of University of Maryland
Computer Science Honors students. In this paper, we explore the runtime
of a gradually typed benchmark program. We run different versions of the benchmark
with different levels of typed and untyped code based on class-level granularity to
see if sound gradual typing is viable in practice, or if the performance
overhead is intolerable.</p>
